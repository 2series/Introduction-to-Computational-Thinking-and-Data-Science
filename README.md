![](images/jv.png)

### Overview

The course teaches how to use computation to accomplish a variety of goals and provides you with a brief introduction to a variety of topics in computational problem solving . This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. One spends a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.

#### Topics covered include:

* Advanced programming in Python 3
* Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
* Dynamic programming
* Plotting with the pylab package
* Random walks
* Probability, Distributions
* Monte Carlo simulations
* Curve fitting
* Statistical fallacies
